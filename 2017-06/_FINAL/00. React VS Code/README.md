[!] Technical Notes:

###
The webpack.config,js contains settings for two loaders
 -- "awesome-typescript-loader"
 --  "babel-loader"
They are alternatives. Both are added because of different tests that was made.

###
commmands:
node_modules/.bin/webpack  (if webpack is not installed globaly)
webpack --progress -p -> production build

node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
/ stop the server with Ctrl+C /
